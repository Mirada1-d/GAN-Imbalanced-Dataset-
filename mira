# GANs for Imbalanced Dataset Classification

This project explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to handle class imbalance.

## Dataset
MNIST with artificial imbalance (digit 9 as minority class).

## Models
- Vanilla GAN
- DCGAN
- CNN Classifier

## Method
GAN-based data augmentation for minority class.

## Results
DCGAN achieved the best performance in improving minority class recall.

## Tools
Python, PyTorch, Jupyter Notebook
